What is in the archive and how to unarchive it?  The archive, "awesome-website.zip," contains the necessary files and resources of the website project. To unarchive it, the team can use the appropriate tool based on the file format. For example, if it is a ZIP archive, they can use the following command in the terminal: unzip awesome-website.zip, This command will extract the contents of the archive and create the necessary directory structure.
What are the commands to start and stop the application? The commands to start and stop the application can vary depending on the specific requirements of your project. However, in a general sense, you might have a couple of common scenarios: a) Starting the application: The command to start the application will depend on the programming language or framework being used. For example, if you are working with a Node.js application, the command might be:node app.js Replace app.js with the main entry point of your application.  b) Stopping the application: The method to stop the application can vary. One common approach is to send a specific signal to the running process. For example, if your application is running in a terminal, you can typically press Ctrl+C to send an interrupt signal and terminate the process.It's important to note that the specific commands to start and stop the application might differ based on your project's configuration and setup. You should consult the project's documentation or the development team for accurate instructions.
How to customize where the application logs are written?  Customizing the location where application logs are written depends on the logging framework or library being used in your application. Typically, you can configure the logging system to specify a specific directory or file path for logs. For example, if you're using a logging library like Log4j in a Java application, you can modify the configuration file (e.g., log4j.properties or log4j.xml) to set the desired log file location.  It's recommended to consult the documentation or resources specific to your logging library for detailed instructions on how to customize the log location.  The exact steps to customize the log location will depend on the logging library you're using. Generally, you'll need to modify the logging configuration file or update the logging settings within your application's code.
How to "quickly" verify that the application is running (health check)?  To quickly verify if the application is running and performing a basic health check, you can perform a simple HTTP request to a designated endpoint or URL that provides a response indicating the application's status.  For example, you can use the curl command in the terminal to make an HTTP GET request to a health check endpoint:
  curl http://localhost:8000/health 
Replace http://localhost:8000/health with the actual URL or endpoint that represents the health check for your application. The response from the server will indicate whether the application is running and functioning correctly.
The specific health check endpoint and response may vary depending on your application framework or setup. You should consult your application's documentation or development team to identify the appropriate endpoint or URL for the health check.
